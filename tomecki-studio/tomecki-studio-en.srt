00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,520
Gothic II: The History of Khorinis

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,880
The world of magic is not so unstable to... Why am I wasting my breath?

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,020
You won't understand this.

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,040
I repeat – leave it to those, who are experienced in the magic arts.

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:31,320
It’s true that the task is difficult, but It doesn’t mean that it overwhelms us.

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,320
I greet you warmly.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:43,220
My name is Andrzej Tomecki and I’m providing a voice in ‘The History of Khorinis’.

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,860
Here you have voiced… I mean this Torrez. He is a mannered and big-headed magician.

9
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:58,200
‘Imagine that we are going on a mission of the highest importance. Of course, I can’t tell details about it.

10
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,860
Me and Damarok are responsible for gathering a necessary equipment.

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:12,100
The problem is, that we are going to do something, which it hasn’t ever been done before us.

12
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,680
In this case, it is difficult to tell a definition of the »necessary«.’

13
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,840
You heard my voice as Torrez a moment ago.

14
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,980
Who is Torrez?

15
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,580
A great magician, who’s got a big knowledge,

16
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,280
being such an arrogant on the other side.

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,700
‘However if the King approves the creation of the Barrier…

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:49,360
as a Fire Magician I can say with all authority… it will be hot’

19
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,560
I don’t know whether he is sympathetic for you,

20
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,480
but I’m sympathetic. Seriously.

21
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,200
Besides, he tired me.

22
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,900
Really.

23
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,300
‘YOU SCUM!’

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,340
That constant journey across sea bores me.

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,860
It can’t be done forever.

26
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,480
Climbing up shrouds, rolling up and down sails,

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:26,200
walking in wet clothes, which can’t be dried, because salt absorbs moisture all the time.

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,420
The boys (from SoulFire) are making a professional work and they deserve our respect.

29
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,360
`You’ve promised that you will betray your comrades! That you will lure the ship into trap!`

30
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:48,660
Best regards to all fans of ‘The History of Khorinis‘ and Gothic.

31
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,920
May Innos watch over you always!

32
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,260
